# DataOps

### Seven DataOps Practices

1. Orchestrate your production pipeline
2. Monitor production data for errors and trends
3. Use multiple self-service environments to experiment outside of production
4. Add automated data and logic tests to catch problems quickly
5. Reuse and containerize components to save time and reduce complexity
6. Parameterize your code so it can run in multiple environments
7. Schedule pipeline processing for regular, predictable deliverables
